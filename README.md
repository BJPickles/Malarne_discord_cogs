A cog to display information about League of Legends, like your ranking, masteries, ranking of your current game, and history (may be slow, need to be modified)
English translation is planned, just have to make the display look better first (it really is awful)

# Leveler
Require Pillow (pip3 install Pillow)

The first Leveler cog made for v3 !
Inspired by Stevy's v2 Leveler
Basic code made by myself, TrustyJaid helped a lot making things look awesome (he entirely made the [p]profile image, big thumbs up to him)
Just use [p]set locale en-US to translate the cog to english !
NB: channel whitelist is enabled by default, if you want people to get xp from all your channels, just use [p]levelerset channel whitelist toggle
NB2: you can customize your profile using profileset !
