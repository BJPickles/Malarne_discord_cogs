# Leveler
Require Pillow (`pip3 install Pillow`)

The first Leveler cog made for v3 !
Inspired by Stevy's v2 Leveler
Basic code made by myself, TrustyJaid helped a lot making things look awesome (he entirely made the [p]profile image, big thumbs up to him)
Just use [p]set locale fr-FR if you want to translate the cog into french !
NB: channel whitelist is enabled by default, if you want people to get xp from all your channels, just use [p]levelerset channel whitelist toggle
NB2: you can customize your profile using profileset !

---

Note that this is using different cog permissions to allow various roles to setxp for a very specific usecase. Most notably for the 91AR Discord. Specifically: ```@commands.has_any_role('Moderator', '91AR Subcommander', 'Developer', 'Mod Team')```.
