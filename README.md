# Boobs

Updated version of https://github.com/Canule/Mash-Cogs oboobs cog
Uploaded with authorization of original author, you can also find that cog on his v3 branch (may not be fully updated)

# League

A cog to display information about League of Legends, like your ranking, masteries, ranking of your current game, and history (may be slow, need to be modified)
English translation is planned, just have to make the display look better first (it really is awful)
NB: This cog may break randomly, for more updated version, use the one under WebLeveler branch, just note it'll work only on dev version until 3.1 version of Red is released

# Apex

A cog to display informations about Apex !
Just note that it can only display informations you have a tracker on your hero.
NB: just like League, it'll work only on dev version until 3.1 is released.

# Leveler
Require Pillow (pip3 install Pillow)

The first Leveler cog made for v3 !
Inspired by Stevy's v2 Leveler
Basic code made by myself, TrustyJaid helped a lot making things look awesome (he entirely made the [p]profile image, big thumbs up to him)
Just use [p]set locale fr-FR if you want to translate the cog into french !
NB: channel whitelist is enabled by default, if you want people to get xp from all your channels, just use [p]levelerset channel whitelist toggle
NB2: you can customize your profile using profileset !
